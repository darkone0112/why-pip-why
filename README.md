# why-pip-why

A brutally efficient Python uninstaller for Windows — born from the ashes of a dev session ruined by broken `pip`, ghosted `pyinstaller`, and the eldritch horror that is Windows PATH management.

This script doesn’t try to fix your Python install. It doesn't gently repair. It doesn't whisper soothing Stack Overflow threads into your ear. It **eradicates**. It will find every Python version installed across your system, every trace left in AppData, every leftover virtualenv hiding in the corner, and wipe it out like it owes you money.

## 💣 What It Does

- Uninstalls **every** Python version it finds, even the cursed half-dead ones
- Deletes:
  - `C:\Program Files\Python*`
  - `AppData\Roaming\Python`
  - `AppData\Local\Programs\Python`
  - `site-packages`, `.virtualenvs`, `pip` caches — *everything*
- Removes Python and pip from your system and user PATHs
- Leaves your system cleaner than the day it was born

## 🧯 When to Use This

- When `pip install` says it's done but `python -m` swears it’s not there  
- When PyInstaller has installed but “doesn’t exist”  
- When your terminal and Windows are gaslighting you in sync  
- When you've uninstalled Python five times and it still shows up like your ex in your task manager

## ⚠️ Warning

This script is not careful. It does not ask for confirmation. It assumes you're done with diplomacy. **Use it only if you're ready to burn everything and start fresh.**

## ✅ Next Steps

After using this script, reboot your machine and head to:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- ✅ Select “Install for all users”
- ✅ Check “Add Python to PATH”
- ✅ Install it somewhere sane like `C:\Python311`, far away from Windows permission hell
